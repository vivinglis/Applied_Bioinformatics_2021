The analyis is divided into four parts not counting the preprocessing scripts. 

Folders:  
_all_genes_: Scripts handling analyses regarding all genes.  
_GO_terms_: Scripts handling analyses regarding GO terms.  
_distance_TE_: Scripts generating plots for methylation level against distance to closest TE for all genes.  
_preprocessing_: Scripts used to generate data tables such as normalised rlog expression values, and calculating methylation level per gene.
_varying_methylation_levels_ : Scripts that were used during the regression analyses and the analyses of the effect of varying levels of methylation on expression.
