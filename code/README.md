The analyse is divided into four parts not counting the preprocessing scripts. 

Preprocessing script are the ones not in a folder, by name: _1_create_rlog_normalised_expression.R_, _1_getting_translation_table.R_  

Folders:  
_all_genes_: Scripts handling analyses regarding all genes.  
_GO_terms_: Scripts handling analyses regarding GO terms.  
_distance_TE_: Scripts generating plots for methylation level against distance to closest TE for all genes.  
_preprocessing_: Scripts used to generate data tables such as normalised rlog expression values, and calculating methylation level per gene.
_varying_methylation_levels_ : Scripts that were used during the regression analyses and the analyses of the effect of varying levels of methylation on expression.
