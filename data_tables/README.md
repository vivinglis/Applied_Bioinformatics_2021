Data tables have been divided into four subfolders. The other datatables present in the main folder are   

Folders:  
_all_genes_: Data tables for analyses regarding all genes.  
_GO_terms_: Data tables for analyses regarding GO terms.  
_distance_TE_: Data tables for methylation level against distance to closest TE for all genes.  
_preprocessing_: Data tables generated during the preprocessing steps (such as normalised rlog expression values, and methylation level per gene).
_varying_methylation_levels_ : Datatables containing Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics comparing the distribution of expression for varying levels of methylation - low (l), medium (m) and high (h). The filenames specify if less, greater or two-sided tests were performed (default is less).
